# The Day The Earth Stood Stupid

Okay, I like a challenge. Yeah, lots of people did. Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. And then the battle's not so bad?

    // test for primitive values
    function isPrimitive(value) {
      return value !== Object(value);
    }

    isPrimitive([]); -> false
    isPrimitive(123); -> true

## Bendin' in the Wind

Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Bender, quit destroying the universe! Hey, guess what you're accessories to. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. And until then, I can never die?

-   I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.
-   Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.
-   Ugh, it's filthy! Why not

## Raging Bender

She also liked to shut up! Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Who are those horrible orange men?

1.  Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
2.  Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
3.  I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.

## The Luck of the Fryrish

Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.
